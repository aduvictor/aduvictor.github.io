  - title: "About Me"
    excerpt: "Hi, my name is Maegan Tucker. I'm currently a PhD candidate at Caltech, under the advisement of [Dr. Aaron Ames](http://ames.caltech.edu/). My research is centered around achieving stable and user-preferred locomotion on robotic assistive devices using formal methods from both **nonlinear control theory** and **machine learning**. My research has been supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the Caltech [RoAMS initiative](http://www.roams.caltech.edu/).

    Aside from my research, I am deeply passionate about furthering DEI efforts within the robotics community. Towards this, I am involved in various initiatives and organizations to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of robotics."
