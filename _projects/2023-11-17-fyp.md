## Introduction to Engineering Graphics and Visualization Final Project

This complete 3D model was created by me and a team of three other Georgia Tech students. First, each part was designed using technical hand sketches. These sketches were then converted into 2D drawings using AutoCAD. The 2D sketches were transformed into 3D models using Inventor. After all parts were created, they were assembled and properly constrained.

The following images show the design process for one of the parts: the head frame for the Mario Kart.
