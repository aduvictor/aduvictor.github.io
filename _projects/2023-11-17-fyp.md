## Introduction to Engineering Graphics and Visualization Final Project

This complete 3D model was created by me and a team of 3 other Georgia Tech students. First, each part was designed using technical hand sketches. Then, these sketches were converted into 2D drawings using AutoCAD. These 2D sketches were then transformed into 3D models using Inventor. After all of the parts were created, they were assembled and properly constrained.

## Design Process

The following images show the design process for one of the parts. This part was the head frame for the Mario Kart.

### Conclusion

This project showcased our ability to transform initial sketches into detailed 2D and 3D models, culminating in a fully assembled and constrained final product. It was a valuable learning experience in both technical skills and teamwork.
